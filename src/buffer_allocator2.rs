///! Buffer allocation internals v2.
///!
///! The [BufferAllocator] is implemented using a list of
///! stacks, with one stack for each port type. When a
///! new buffer is required, we first try and pop a buffer
///! off the stack. If it none are available, we allocate
///! a new buffer. When a buffer is released, it is
///! pushed to the top of the corresponding stack.
///!
///! There is some additional bookkeeping required for the
///! buffers. [BufferRef]s contain a `ref_count` field which
///! tracks the number of edges that still need the buffer
///! to be alive before it can be safely released. The
///! `generation` field is kept around for visualization
///! of the assigned buffers during debugging.
///!
///! Finally, the engine using the graph needs to know
///! the maximum number of buffers for each port type
///! to allocate during its prepare for playback operation.
///! We track this by counting each time a new buffer
///! is allocated for a type in the `counts` list.
///!
///! Since it is not valid for the buffer allocator to
///! keep allocating after the `counts` field has been
///! consumed, we require consuming `self` to retrieve it.
